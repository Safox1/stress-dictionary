# stress-dictionary
This stress dictionary was created as a subset of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program's negative emotion dictionary in order to precisely assess stress from social media data. It consists of 270 words and word stems categorized with the negative emotion of stress (for example,  “abuse*”,  “attack*”,  “fear”, etc.). The words ending with “&ast;” denote word stems and the asterisk serves as a wildcard, so for example, “alarm*” will match “alarm”, “alarming”, “alarmed”, “alarms”, etc.
